This is how i want my website to structurally function:

index.html 
    ^
    |
    v
login.html <--->  register.html 
    ^
    |
    v
SH.html  <-------|
    ^            v
    |           SSB.html 
    v             ^
SR.html  < ------ |


index.html:
    - general home page that includes the button for the login.
    - it will contain similar style to the mru job board html

login.html: 
    - contains a form that when submitted, it will check if the account exists in the database then give an auth key.
    - if student wants to create an account then there will be a separate button that links it to that html.

register.html:
    - a simple form where the person can create an account (as long as the email and/or student id doesn't exist in the database).
    - returns to login.html when account is created.
    - note: form will auto create information based on the university details like student id etc

SH.html (student home):
    - it will contain similar information such as the "mruGradU8" detailing things like gpa, current courses, program requirements, etc.

SR.html (student registration):
    - this will be the official student registration page where the student can register for their courses.
    - can import schedules created in the student schedule builder.

SSB.html (Student Schedule builder):
    - this will act like the my schedule builder on mru
    - it is where the student can create mock schedules and then use the student registration tab to carry over their final schedule
    - it will also contain course information like my schedule builder.
SH.html, SR.html, and SSB.html are going to act like sub-tabs that the student can access.
