Basic Step By Step process to use node js:

1. create js files in frontend/src/
2. build the js files using vite
3. copy the files over to flaskr/static/js/
4. run code as normal

node js allows me to export/import from other js files.
it also allows me to use any additional tools that i may want to use in the future. 
that is about all i know.
